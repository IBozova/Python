Python exercises which I used to prepare for the Artificial Intelligence module in SoftUni.\
It contains my practice in:

1) creating and modifying the different Python data structures (dicts, lists, sets, tuples, arrays). 
2) working with ints, strings, floats.
3) loops 
4) functions
5) very basic OOP
